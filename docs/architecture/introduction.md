# Introduction

This document outlines the complete technical architecture for RobustCBRN Eval, a robust evaluation pipeline for CBRN-related AI safety benchmarks. It serves as the authoritative guide for implementing a system that identifies and removes 25-35% of exploitable MCQA questions using proven robustification techniques while maintaining radical dependency minimization and fail-graceful operation.

The architecture prioritizes transparency, auditability, and resilience, ensuring that every algorithm can be understood by judges in minutes while gracefully degrading when resources are constrained.
