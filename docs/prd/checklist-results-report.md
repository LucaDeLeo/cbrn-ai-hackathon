# Checklist Results Report

## Executive Summary
- **Overall PRD completeness**: 85%
- **MVP scope appropriateness**: Just Right (focused on core robustification techniques)
- **Readiness for architecture phase**: Nearly Ready (minor gaps in operational details)
- **Most critical gaps**: Limited user research documentation, operational requirements need expansion

## Category Analysis

| Category                         | Status  | Critical Issues |
| -------------------------------- | ------- | --------------- |
| 1. Problem Definition & Context  | PASS    | None - Excellent problem articulation with quantified impact |
| 2. MVP Scope Definition          | PASS    | None - Clear MVP with fallback strategies |
| 3. User Experience Requirements  | PARTIAL | CLI-focused, limited end-user journey mapping |
| 4. Functional Requirements       | PASS    | None - Comprehensive with clear acceptance criteria |
| 5. Non-Functional Requirements   | PASS    | None - Detailed performance and security requirements |
| 6. Epic & Story Structure        | PASS    | None - Well-structured with parallel execution plan |
| 7. Technical Guidance            | PASS    | None - Radical minimalism approach well-documented |
| 8. Cross-Functional Requirements | PARTIAL | Data retention and operational monitoring underspecified |
| 9. Clarity & Communication       | PASS    | None - Clear language with strategic reasoning |

## Key Strengths
- Clear problem statement with quantified impact (31.81% exploitable questions)
- Radical dependency minimization strategy reduces implementation risk
- Parallel development plan maximizes 4-person team efficiency
- Comprehensive fallback strategies at every level
- Security-conscious design with hash-based anonymization

## Areas for Improvement
- **HIGH**: Add operational monitoring and deployment specifications
- **MEDIUM**: Finalize model selection and quantization plan (note: minimal dependency permitted)
- **LOW**: Include architecture and artifact-flow diagrams (internal vs public)

## MVP Validation
The MVP scope is appropriately sized for a 48-hour hackathon with clear priorities:
1. Core statistical analysis (CPU-only fallback)
2. Model consensus detection (primary contribution)
3. Optional enhancements (cloze scoring, visualization)

## Technical Readiness
Technical constraints are well-defined with explicit compute budgets, memory requirements, and fallback strategies. The radical transparency approach with minimal dependencies is a strategic advantage.
