# Epic List

**Epic 1: Foundation & Core Pipeline** - *Establish minimal infrastructure with working data flow and first bias detection*
Get the basic pipeline running end-to-end with simple longest-answer heuristic to prove the architecture works. This gives us a working demo within the first 6 hours.

**Epic 2: Statistical Analysis Engine** - *Implement transparent bias detection algorithms with bootstrap confidence intervals*
Build our "from-scratch" statistical implementations that judges can read and trust. This is our differentiation - every algorithm transparent and documented.

**Epic 3: Model Consensus Detection** - *Add multi-model consensus voting for exploitable question identification*
Implement the Deep Ignorance Â§D.4 approach with 2-3 models. This is our primary technical contribution and highest-impact feature.

**Epic 4: Robust Splitting & Reporting** - *Generate validated subsets with comprehensive bias documentation*
Create the final outputs that users actually need - robust question sets, detailed reports, and security-conscious result presentation.
