# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
• Deliver a practical, validated pipeline that identifies and removes 25-35% of exploitable MCQA questions using proven robustification techniques
• Reduce evaluation variance from 5-10% to <2% through statistical validation and multiple benchmark variants
• Provide transparent, reproducible bias detection methods with 95% confidence intervals for all filtering decisions
• Generate both robust MCQA subsets and verified cloze format variants that together provide more reliable capability assessment
• Create open-source infrastructure that enables the AI safety community to validate evaluation claims with confidence
• Demonstrate 15-25% score reduction on robust vs original benchmarks, revealing true model capabilities vs statistical artifacts
• Process 1,000-3,000 questions within 4 hours using <$300 in compute resources
• Establish foundation for future comprehensive bias detection and evaluation standards

## Background Context

Current AI safety evaluations for CBRN risks suffer from systematic vulnerabilities where models can achieve high scores through pattern exploitation rather than genuine knowledge. The WMDP benchmark reveals that 31.81% of Bio questions are answerable without reading the question stem, and simple heuristics like selecting the longest answer achieve 46% accuracy. This evaluation crisis is recognized at the highest levels - NIST lists CBRN capabilities as the first GAI-specific risk, while regulatory reports bluntly state "no proper safety evaluation tools exist yet."

RobustCBRN Eval implements the validated Deep Ignorance §D.4 consensus detection method combined with verified cloze scoring and statistical heuristics to address these critical gaps. By applying proven debiasing techniques with novel enhancements within realistic hackathon constraints, we provide academic researchers and safety evaluation organizations with the reproducible, trustworthy assessment methods they urgently need before flawed evaluations lead to catastrophic misjudgments about AI safety.
