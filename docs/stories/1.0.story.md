# Story 1.0: Repository & Project Initialization

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** proper repository initialization and project setup,
**so that** the team has a clean foundation to start development.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Initialize git repository with proper .gitignore (Python, PyTorch, cache dirs, logs, __pycache__)
2. Create initial README.md with project title, description, and placeholder sections
3. Set up branch protection rules for main branch (if using GitHub)
4. Create initial commit with conventional message format
5. Set up project metadata files (LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING.md placeholders)
6. Initialize Python virtual environment setup script (using uv)
7. Create development setup documentation in docs/development-setup.md

## Tasks / Subtasks
Note: Some items in this repository are already present (e.g., `.gitignore`, `README.md`, initial source/tests/scripts). When encountered, validate existing artifacts rather than recreating them, and record verification in Dev Agent Record → Completion Notes.

## Dev Notes

### Repository Structure Requirements
From [Source: architecture/project-structure.md]:
The project must follow the defined structure with main directories:
- `src/` - Core application code with submodules
- `tests/` - Test files and fixtures
- `configs/` - Configuration files
- `data/` - Input data directory
- `cache/` - Cache storage
- `results/` - Output directory
- `logs/` - Log files
- `scripts/` - Setup and utility scripts
- `cli.py` - Main CLI entry point at root

### Technology Stack
From [Sources: architecture/tech-stack.md (Core Dependencies), architecture/development-workflow.md#Local Development Setup (uv setup)]:
- **Language**: Python 3.10+ (ML ecosystem standard)
- **Package Manager**: uv (fast Python package manager)
- **Testing**: unittest (built-in, adequate for needs)
- **Logging**: logging module (standard library)
- **CLI**: argparse (built-in, simple and sufficient)
- **Config**: dataclasses (built-in, type-safe, no deps)

### Development Workflow Setup
From [Source: architecture/development-workflow.md#Local Development Setup]:
- Use uv for package management (10x faster than pip)
- Install with: `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`
- Create venv: `uv venv`
- Activate: `source .venv/bin/activate` (Linux/Mac) or `.venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows)
- Install deps: `uv pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Version Control Standards
- Use conventional commit messages format
- Main branch should be protected
- All changes through pull requests
- Commit types: feat, fix, docs, chore, test, build, refactor

### Testing Requirements
From [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]:
- Unit tests should cover 70% of codebase
- Use unittest.TestCase for all tests
- Tests must run in <10 seconds locally
- Include smoke tests for basic functionality
- Test files follow pattern: test_*.py

### Security Considerations
- Never commit secrets or API keys
- Use .env files for local configuration (excluded in .gitignore)
- Hash-based anonymization for sensitive data
- All cache and results excluded from version control

### File Naming Conventions
- Python files: lowercase with underscores (snake_case)
- Test files: prefix with test_
- Config files: lowercase with .json extension
- Documentation: lowercase with hyphens for multi-word

### Initial Dependencies
This story focuses on repository setup only. Core dependencies (torch, transformers, numpy, tqdm) will be added in Story 1.1.

### Testing

#### Test File Locations
From [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#Test Organization]:
- All tests in `tests/` directory
- Test files named `test_*.py`
- Fixtures in `tests/fixtures/`
- Use built-in `unittest` framework

#### Testing Standards
- Write tests for all new functionality
- Maintain >70% code coverage
- Tests must be deterministic
- Use fixed seeds for reproducibility
- Mock external dependencies

#### Story-Specific Tests
For this initialization story:
- Verify directory structure exists
- Check Python version compatibility
- Validate setup scripts execution
- Ensure git repository initialized correctly
- Test that all documentation files exist
- Verify branch protection configured per docs/github-setup.md (require PR review(s), required status checks, dismiss stale reviews, include administrators, up-to-date branch requirement). Record evidence in Dev Agent Record → Completion Notes.

### Open Questions / Risks
- License selection (MIT vs. other) — confirm before creating LICENSE.
- Python version pin (3.10 vs. 3.11) — align with CI and tooling.
- CI matrix and required status checks naming — define to make branch protections enforceable.

### Rollback Plan
- If scaffolding causes issues, revert via a single rollback commit or `git revert` of the initialization commits.
