Status: Draft

Story
- As a user running full suites,
- I want a single orchestration script and a configurable consensus threshold,
- so that I can run everything consistently and tune consensus without code changes.

Acceptance Criteria
- `scripts/run_all.sh` orchestrates MCQ full, MCQ choices-only, Cloze (per mode), benign pairs, paraphrase, and perturbation tasks with one config (`.env` + env overrides).
- Progress messages and a run time summary are printed for major phases in `scripts/run_evalset.sh` and `run_all.sh`.
- Majority consensus threshold `k` is configurable via env/flag (e.g., `CONSENSUS_K`) and is wired into aggregation and any consensus calculations.
- `make run` and `scripts/run_evalset.sh` pass `CONSENSUS_K` through to `robustcbrn.analysis.aggregate` or a CLI param.
- Docs updated to describe the new script and `k` parameter.

Tasks / Subtasks
- Add `scripts/run_all.sh` using existing scripts as building blocks; ensure idempotent log dirs and results aggregation at the end.
- Add `--k` to `robustcbrn.analysis.aggregate` CLI and thread to `majority_consensus(df, k)`.
- Update `scripts/run_evalset.sh` to show simple phase timing and a short summary at the end (elapsed seconds, models, seeds, subset).
- Update `docs/USAGE.md` with examples for `run_all.sh` and `CONSENSUS_K`.

Dev Notes
- Reference: `Makefile`, `scripts/run_evalset.sh`, `robustcbrn/analysis/aggregate.py`.
- Keep default `k=2` for backward compatibility.

Testing
- Dry run with `SUBSET=32` to ensure end-to-end orchestration completes and summary prints.
- Unit test `aggregate.cli` parses and passes `--k` correctly.
