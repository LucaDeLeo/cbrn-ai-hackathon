Status: Draft

Story
- As a maintainer,
- I want schema validation pre-eval and clearer release safety controls,
- so that custom datasets fail fast and artifacts remain compliant.

Acceptance Criteria
- Pre-eval schema checks run in `scripts/run_evalset.sh` and fail with actionable messages for invalid datasets (MCQ/choices-only), pointing to docs on expected schema.
- `docs/USAGE.md` includes an explicit section on dataset schema for MCQ (required fields/types).
- `scripts/validate_release.sh` supports an allowlist of safe metadata columns via env (e.g., `VALIDATE_SAFE_COLUMNS=...`) and treats them as permitted in CSVs.
- `load_mcq_dataset` path guard behavior is documented in `docs/USAGE.md` or simplified to a clearer error; no surprising path errors.

Tasks / Subtasks
- Add a CLI entry or small wrapper for `robustcbrn.utils.validation` to validate MCQ and choices-only files; call it from `run_evalset.sh` before eval loops.
- Extend `validate_release.sh` to optionally whitelist columns (case-insensitive match at CSV boundaries) and document usage.
- Update `docs/USAGE.md` with schema examples and common failure messages.
- Review/simplify `load_mcq_dataset` path guard and adjust error messages for clarity.

Dev Notes
- Reference: `robustcbrn/utils/validation.py`, `scripts/run_evalset.sh`, `scripts/validate_release.sh`.
- Ensure exit codes differentiate schema vs release policy failures.

Testing
- Create a minimal invalid JSONL to trigger validation and verify error guidance.
- Run `bash scripts/validate_release.sh` on artifacts to confirm safe-column allowlist works as intended.
