Status: Draft

Story
- As a CI maintainer,
- I want a smoke test for the cloze HF path and better caching,
- so that CI validates critical paths quickly and runs faster.

Acceptance Criteria
- A small unit/smoke test exercises the cloze HF scorer on a tiny model or is guarded by a flag (`RUN_HF_CLOZE_SMOKE=1`) to skip in restricted environments.
- CI caches pip/uv to speed up repeated runs in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
- CI remains green in restricted/no-network mode (HF smoke test skips cleanly when disabled).

Tasks / Subtasks
- Add `tests/test_cloze_hf.py` with parametrization:
  - If `RUN_HF_CLOZE_SMOKE` is set, run a tiny model (e.g., `sshleifer/tiny-gpt2`) or mock HF components to verify `score_cloze_options` path and output shape.
  - Else, assert importability and skip with reason.
- Update CI workflow to add caching for pip/uv and optionally set `RUN_HF_CLOZE_SMOKE=0` by default.

Dev Notes
- Reference: `robustcbrn/tasks/cloze_full.py`, new `cloze_logprob.py` wrapper, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
- Keep runtime under a few seconds when enabled; prefer mocking if network is not available.

Testing
- Local: run `RUN_HF_CLOZE_SMOKE=0 make test` and confirm skip; optionally enable with cached tiny model to verify path once.
