Status: Draft

Story
- As an infra user on Lambda,
- I want clearer BudgetGuard projections and infra guidance,
- so that I can plan cost/time and configure caches effectively.

Acceptance Criteria
- `scripts/run_evalset.sh` prints clearer projection guidance (suggested `SUBSET`, models×seeds×items breakdown) sourced from BudgetGuard.
- `docs/USAGE.md` or `README.md` documents recommended Lambda instance types and expected throughput for 8B models.
- `.env.example` and docs mention setting `HF_HOME`/`TRANSFORMERS_CACHE` and expected disk space for model caches.
- Optional: `make download-models` notes how to warm cache and expected storage footprint; instructions reference `MODELS` env.

Tasks / Subtasks
- Improve projection printouts in `scripts/run_evalset.sh` and add a short guide paragraph in `BudgetGuard` or echo output.
- Update docs for instance type guidance (A100 40/80GB, CUDA version) and throughput expectations.
- Update `.env.example` with commented `HF_HOME` and `TRANSFORMERS_CACHE` examples and brief note.

Dev Notes
- Reference: `robustcbrn/budget_guard.py`, `.env.example`, `scripts/download_models.sh`, `scripts/run_evalset.sh`.

Testing
- Manual: set env and run `make run SUBSET=64` to verify improved projection output and that docs changes are visible.
